# Cognitive Unload

The goal of this theme is to minimize cognitive load while coding. To that end, it's goals are to:

- Reduce visibility of low-value information
- Increase visibility of high-value information
- Maximize visual separation of disparate elements
- Draw attention to time-sensitive information (errors, selections, search results)

This theme starts with "Dark Modern" as the base.

## Visual Priority

This extension creates a visual hierarchy to match the importance of editor and code content. That heirarchy is, approximately:

1. Time-Sensitive Information
  - Alerts
  - Selections
2. Control Flow Landmarks
3. Code Behavior
  - Operators
  - Function calls
4. Identifiers
