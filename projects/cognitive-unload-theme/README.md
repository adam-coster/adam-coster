# Cognitive Unload

The goal of this theme is to minimize cognitive load while coding. To that end, it's goals are to:

- Reduce visibility of low-value information
- Increase visibility of high-value information
- Maximize visual separation of disparate elements
- Draw attention to time-sensitive information (errors, selections, search results)

This theme is a work in progress -- it may change dramatically at any moment!
