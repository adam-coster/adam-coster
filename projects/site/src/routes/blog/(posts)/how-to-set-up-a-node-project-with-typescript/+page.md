Learning how to code is a long process. Structured coursework and tutorials are a great way for most people to learn, especially at the beginning, but at some point you start to wonder... what does the _actual work_ of development look like? How do you go from identifying a problem to a deployable project that _solves_ that problem?

I had a (relatively) small side project I wanted to tackle for fun, and decided to do it live on video so that people could see the whole process from start to finish.

If you:

- Love the Node/JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem and want to get _real deep_ into how it all works together; or
- Are having trouble using your programming knowledge to build full solutions; or
- Are actively developing your fluency in programming in general or JavaScript/Node/Typescript in specific; or
- Enjoy the calming background sounds of someone talking about nerd stuff

... then this will be right up your alley!

In Episode 1 I go through the process of setting up a new Node + Typescript project and present the problem being solved: converting Git logs into changelogs/patchnotes.
