- Milestone: Deployable
  - Get builds to work properly
    - Currently fail on first build due to the creation of static files during the build process. Apparently those files are not discoverable by the rest of the build process. They need to be treated as dynamic routes instead, presumably.
  - Get built and deploying in GitHub pages, via the default GitHub URL
    - Test legacy URL redirects
    - Have NO ROBOTS always be true when not on the canonical location
    - Test all pages
- Milestone: Deployed
  - Get Google Search ownership working
  - Update all Dev.to posts to set new canonical URL
  - Update Medium posts to set new canonical URL
- Miscellaneous future features
  - Have the Podcast link go to a page explaining the podcast
  - Add a `/uses` page
  - Add a [skip link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#skip_links)
  - Create an identity graph linking all of my digital identities together
  - Make headings clickable (to get direct links).
  - Reorganize to get rid of the multi-package setup
  - Find other articles and migrate
    - Sources:
      - The Bscotch blog (pull down with script)
      - Gamasutra (only a few, may also already be on the Bscotch blog)
    - Process
      - Find those worth migrating
      - Find all cross-posted URLs for each
      - Update internal URLs
      - Choose appropriate canonical URL
      - Choose appropriate title & slug
      - Create a description
  - Add share buttons to article pages
  - Add links back to source on GitHub
  - Add print styling
  - Add "light" color scheme (and maybe others)
  - Add distinct page linking to _all_ web service identifiers
  - Add distinct page for code projects with info
  - Add "advanced" search info to articles (list allowed fields, link to [lunr docs](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html))
  - Create a tag hierarchy system and ensure all articles match it
  - Update header to either remove my portrait or make it part of the navbar
  - Add TOOLS section with useful web-based tools
    - Zapier code editor (the built-in one has no Intellisense). Is this hard to do?
