## Valheim Servers

- Set my ENV properties in the Valheim CDK app
- Test CDK deployment with just the S3 bucket & Beanstalk App
- Add the `docker-compose` as an S3 asset (I think?) so that it can be deployed to environments
- Code up the environments along with appropriate environment variables and other config options
